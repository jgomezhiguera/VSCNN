# Visual sentimen analysis using CNN

The project contains main findings related with transfer learning using Tensorflow, Keras, fastai and D2L and test new proposed architectures. All of them are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and for the best training model fine tunning techniques have been applied.

Access to hardware is a barrier to training more epochs, more deep networks or use big datasets.

## Technical requierements

Hardware is a main issue when you try to training CNN. The models presented in this document were tested using Google Colab Pro and a AWS EC2 instance.

Colab PRO is a paid service thah offer more RAM compared with free version and access to better GPU, but this access is limited in process time and hardware. Information related with this service could be consult in https://colab.research.google.com/signup#

## Datasets

The models included in this document were training on "Users" dataset and testing for "Users Boston City", as a part of "Visual Sentiment Analysis for Review Images with
Item-Oriented and User-Oriented CNN" writed by Truong et.al in 2017 and reviewed in 2020 as "Reproducibility Companion Paper: Visual Sentiment Analysis for Review Images with Item-Oriented and User-Oriented CNN" by the same authors. 

Datasets could be download follow the instructions in https://github.com/PreferredAI/vs-cnn/tree/reproducibility

Users dataset -used for training- consist of 45.646 images from YELP reviews and Users Boston dataset has 1.194 images for validation.

All of the datasets included in mentioned documents could not be used due to their size and restrictions related with hardware avalaible.

## Models

According to the articles mentioned, the authors propose the following architecture for the problem of binary sentiment classification based on images:

__"RÃ©plica"__ model try to training a similar architecture.
